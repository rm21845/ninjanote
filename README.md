## User Story
I am able to easily visit this site and write a note my friend. My note deals with a private matter, so I am happy that this note will be protected from prying eyes. I create the note, and I recieve the corresponding link to send to my friend. They put in the password and read the note. When they are finished, the note ceases to exist.
